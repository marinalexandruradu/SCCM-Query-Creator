A simple but yet usefull app to easily convert a list of machines/users to an SCCM query.

In the "Text Converter" tab, you can convert your string by selecting a default separator (; or ,) or even use your own. After the conversion, you should have a list separated by a new line.

Navigate to the "Query Creator" tab and paste the list, select the desired query (machines or users) and click Generate.

Very usefull if you want to split the list in multiple queries, just input the desired split and the program automatically does it.
